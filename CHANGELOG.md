## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project structure and documentation
- Comprehensive design specification for golden image deployment
- Implementation guidelines for coding agents
- Example configurations for various deployment scenarios
- Cross-platform build support for Linux architectures

### Planned
- Complete Rust implementation of golden image system
- VM-based Ubuntu image creation with QEMU/KVM
- LUKS full disk encryption setup and deployment
- SSH-based remote deployment capabilities
- Netboot/PXE integration for bare metal deployment
- Web-based status dashboard and reporting
- Multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64)
- Integration testing with real target machines

## Project Background

This project was created to replace a complex and unreliable shell script-based Ubuntu autoinstall system. The original system consisted of:

- **jinstall.sh**: ~500 lines of shell script handling disk partitioning, LUKS encryption, ZFS setup, and debootstrap installation
- **variables.sh**: Configuration management and environment setup
- **reporting.sh**: Status reporting and webhook integration

### Problems with Shell-Based Approach

1. **Reliability Issues**: Shell scripts prone to failures with inconsistent error handling
2. **Performance Problems**: Debootstrap installations taking 45+ minutes per machine
3. **Maintenance Burden**: Complex shell logic difficult to debug and extend
4. **Security Concerns**: Inconsistent handling of sensitive data like LUKS passphrases
5. **Scalability Limitations**: No parallelization or batch deployment support

### Golden Image Solution

The new Rust-based approach implements a golden image strategy:

1. **Image Creation**: Build Ubuntu images once in controlled VM environment
2. **Generalization**: Strip machine-specific information for reuse
3. **Fast Deployment**: Deploy pre-built images in ~5 minutes vs 45+ minutes
4. **Consistency**: Every deployment uses identical base image
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and validation throughout process

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Project setup and repository creation
- [x] Comprehensive design documentation
- [x] Implementation guidelines for automated development
- [x] Example configurations matching existing infrastructure

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Rust application structure and CLI interface
- [ ] VM management and image creation system
- [ ] LUKS encryption and disk management
- [ ] Configuration system and validation
- [ ] Basic deployment via SSH

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Netboot/PXE integration for bare metal deployment
- [ ] Web dashboard for monitoring and management
- [ ] Batch deployment and parallel operations
- [ ] Advanced error recovery and rollback
- [ ] Performance optimization and caching

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with real hardware
- [ ] Security audit and hardening
- [ ] Documentation and training materials
- [ ] Migration from shell scripts to Rust system
- [ ] Production deployment and monitoring

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture Choices

- **Rust Language**: Chosen for memory safety, performance, and excellent async support
- **Golden Images**: 10x performance improvement over debootstrap approach
- **QEMU/KVM**: Industry standard for VM management and image creation
- **LUKS Encryption**: Full disk encryption by default for security compliance
- **Modular Design**: Separate concerns for maintainability and testing

### Dependencies

- **tokio**: Async runtime for concurrent operations
- **clap**: Command-line interface with excellent user experience
- **serde**: Configuration serialization with YAML support
- **reqwest**: HTTP client for downloads with progress tracking
- **anyhow**: Error handling with context preservation

### Security Considerations

- **No Credential Logging**: Sensitive data never appears in logs
- **Environment Variables**: Secure method for passing secrets
- **HTTPS Only**: All network operations use encrypted connections
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before processing
- **Minimal Privileges**: Operations use least required permissions

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon lessons learned from the existing shell script infrastructure and incorporates best practices from:

- Ubuntu's autoinstall documentation and community examples
- Rust async ecosystem patterns and practices
- Enterprise deployment tools and methodologies
- Security frameworks for disk encryption and secure deployment

The migration from shell scripts to Rust represents a significant improvement in reliability, performance, and maintainability for Ubuntu server deployment automation.
