# TypeScript Coding Instructions

- Follow the [general coding instructions](general-coding.instructions.md).
- Follow the
  [Google TypeScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html)
  for additional best practices.
- All TypeScript files must begin with the required file header (see general
  instructions for details and TypeScript example).

## Core Principles

- Readability: Code should be clear and understandable
- Consistency: Follow established patterns and conventions
- Type Safety: Use TypeScript features to catch errors at compile time
- Simplicity: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions

## File Organization

- Use `.ts` for TypeScript files, `.tsx` for TypeScript with JSX
- Use ES6 import/export style
- License header (if required), then imports, then main export, then
  implementation

## Naming Conventions

- camelCase for variables and functions
- PascalCase for classes and interfaces
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for module-level constants
- Use descriptive names, avoid abbreviations
- Use PascalCase for enum names and members

## Type Annotations

- Always annotate function parameters and return types
- Use arrow functions for short functions
- Use explicit types for complex objects
- Use interfaces for object shapes that might be extended
- Use type aliases for unions, primitives, or computed types

## Google TypeScript Style Guide (Complete)

This section contains the complete Google TypeScript Style Guide content for comprehensive reference.

### Introduction

This Style Guide uses RFC 2119 terminology when using the phrases must, must not, should, should not, and may. The terms prefer and avoid correspond to should and should not, respectively. Imperative and declarative statements are prescriptive and correspond to must.

All examples given are non-normative and serve only to illustrate the normative language of the style guide. That is, while the examples are in Google Style, they may not illustrate the only stylish way to represent the code. Optional formatting choices made in examples must not be enforced as rules.

### Source File Basics

#### File Encoding: UTF-8
Source files are encoded in UTF-8.

##### Whitespace Characters
Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character (0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file. This implies that all other whitespace characters in string literals are escaped.

##### Special Escape Sequences
For any character that has a special escape sequence (`\'`, `\"`, `\\`, `\b`, `\f`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\v`), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding numeric escape (e.g `\x0a`, `\u000a`, or `\u{a}`). Legacy octal escapes are never used.

##### Non-ASCII Characters
For the remaining non-ASCII characters, use the actual Unicode character (e.g. `∞`). For non-printable characters, the equivalent hex or Unicode escapes (e.g. `\u221e`) can be used along with an explanatory comment.

```typescript
// Perfectly clear, even without a comment.
const units = 'μs';

// Use escapes for non-printable characters.
const output = '\ufeff' + content;  // byte order mark
```

### Source File Structure

Files consist of the following, in order:
1. Copyright information, if present
2. JSDoc with `@fileoverview`, if present
3. Imports, if present
4. The file's implementation

Exactly one blank line separates each section that is present.

#### Copyright Information
If license or copyright information is necessary in a file, add it in a JSDoc at the top of the file.

#### @fileoverview JSDoc
A file may have a top-level `@fileoverview` JSDoc. If present, it may provide a description of the file's content, its uses, or information about its dependencies. Wrapped lines are not indented.

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Description of file. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
 * adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt.
 */
```

#### Imports
There are four variants of import statements in ES6 and TypeScript:

| Type | Import Style | Usage |
|------|-------------|--------|
| module | `import * as foo from '...';` | TypeScript imports |
| named | `import {SomeThing} from '...';` | TypeScript imports |
| default | `import SomeThing from '...';` | Only for other external code that requires them |
| side-effect | `import '...';` | Only to import libraries for their side-effects on load |

```typescript
// Good: choose between two options as appropriate (see below).
import * as ng from '@angular/core';
import {Foo} from './foo';

// Only when needed: default imports.
import Button from 'Button';

// Sometimes needed to import libraries for their side effects:
import 'jasmine';
import '@polymer/paper-button';
```

##### Import Paths
TypeScript code must use paths to import other TypeScript code. Paths may be relative, i.e. starting with `.` or `..`, or rooted at the base directory, e.g. `root/path/to/file`.

Code should use relative imports (`./foo`) rather than absolute imports `path/to/foo` when referring to files within the same (logical) project as this allows to move the project around without introducing changes in these imports.

##### Namespace versus Named Imports
Both namespace and named imports can be used.

Prefer named imports for symbols used frequently in a file or for symbols that have clear names, for example Jasmine's `describe` and `it`. Named imports can be aliased to clearer names as needed with `as`.

Prefer namespace imports when using many different symbols from large APIs. A namespace import, despite using the `*` character, is not comparable to a "wildcard" import as seen in other languages.

```typescript
// Bad: overlong import statement of needlessly namespaced names.
import {Item as TableviewItem, Header as TableviewHeader, Row as TableviewRow,
  Model as TableviewModel, Renderer as TableviewRenderer} from './tableview';

let item: TableviewItem|undefined;
```

```typescript
// Better: use the module for namespacing.
import * as tableview from './tableview';

let item: tableview.Item|undefined;
```

##### Renaming Imports
Code should fix name collisions by using a namespace import or renaming the exports themselves. Code may rename imports (`import {SomeThing as SomeOtherThing}`) if needed.

Three examples where renaming can be helpful:
1. If it's necessary to avoid collisions with other imported symbols.
2. If the imported symbol name is generated.
3. If importing symbols whose names are unclear by themselves, renaming can improve code clarity.

#### Exports
Use named exports in all code:

```typescript
// Use named exports:
export class Foo { ... }
```

Do not use default exports. This ensures that all imports follow a uniform pattern.

```typescript
// Do not use default exports:
export default class Foo { ... } // BAD!
```

**Why?** Default exports provide no canonical name, which makes central maintenance difficult with relatively little benefit to code owners, including potentially decreased readability.

Named exports have the benefit of erroring when import statements try to import something that hasn't been declared.

##### Export Visibility
TypeScript does not support restricting the visibility for exported symbols. Only export symbols that are used outside of the module. Generally minimize the exported API surface of modules.

##### Mutable Exports
Regardless of technical support, mutable exports can create hard to understand and debug code, in particular with re-exports across multiple modules. One way to paraphrase this style point is that `export let` is not allowed.

```typescript
export let foo = 3;
// In pure ES6, foo is mutable and importers will observe the value change after a second.
// In TS, if foo is re-exported by a second file, importers will not see the value change.
window.setTimeout(() => {
  foo = 4;
}, 1000 /* ms */);
```

If one needs to support externally accessible and mutable bindings, they should instead use explicit getter functions.

##### Container Classes
Do not create container classes with static methods or properties for the sake of namespacing.

```typescript
export class Container {
  static FOO = 1;
  static bar() { return 1; }
}
```

Instead, export individual constants and functions:

```typescript
export const FOO = 1;
export function bar() { return 1; }
```

### Language Features

#### Local Variable Declarations

##### Use const and let
Always use `const` or `let` to declare variables. Use `const` by default, unless a variable needs to be reassigned. Never use `var`.

```typescript
const foo = otherValue;  // Use if "foo" never changes.
let bar = someValue;     // Use if "bar" is ever assigned into later on.
```

`const` and `let` are block scoped, like variables in most other languages. `var` in JavaScript is function scoped, which can cause difficult to understand bugs. Don't use it.

Variables must not be used before their declaration.

##### One Variable Per Declaration
Every local variable declaration declares only one variable: declarations such as `let a = 1, b = 2;` are not used.

#### Array Literals

##### Do not use the Array Constructor
Do not use the `Array()` constructor, with or without `new`. It has confusing and contradictory usage:

```typescript
const a = new Array(2); // [undefined, undefined]
const b = new Array(2, 3); // [2, 3];
```

Instead, always use bracket notation to initialize arrays, or `from` to initialize an `Array` with a certain size:

```typescript
const a = [2];
const b = [2, 3];

// Equivalent to Array(2):
const c = [];
c.length = 2;

// [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Array.from<number>({length: 5}).fill(0);
```

##### Do not define properties on arrays
Do not define or use non-numeric properties on an array (other than `length`). Use a `Map` (or `Object`) instead.

##### Using spread syntax
Using spread syntax `[...foo];` is a convenient shorthand for shallow-copying or concatenating iterables.

```typescript
const foo = [1];
const foo2 = [...foo, 6, 7];
const foo3 = [5, ...foo];

foo2[1] === 6;
foo3[1] === 1;
```

When using spread syntax, the value being spread must match what is being created. When creating an array, only spread iterables. Primitives (including `null` and `undefined`) must not be spread.

##### Array destructuring
Array literals may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment to perform destructuring (such as when unpacking multiple values from a single array or iterable). A final "rest" element may be included (with no space between the `...` and the variable name). Elements should be omitted if they are unused.

```typescript
const [a, b, c, ...rest] = generateResults();
let [, b,, d] = someArray;
```

Destructuring may also be used for function parameters. Always specify `[]` as the default value if a destructured array parameter is optional, and provide default values on the left hand side:

```typescript
function destructured([a = 4, b = 2] = []) { … }
```

#### Object Literals

##### Do not use the Object Constructor
The `Object` constructor is disallowed. Use an object literal (`{}` or `{a: 0, b: 1, c: 2}`) instead.

##### Iterating objects
Iterating objects with `for (... in ...)` is error prone. It will include enumerable properties from the prototype chain.

Do not use unfiltered `for (... in ...)` statements:

```typescript
for (const x in someObj) {
  // x could come from some parent prototype!
}
```

Either filter values explicitly with an `if` statement, or use `for (... of Object.keys(...))`.

```typescript
for (const x in someObj) {
  if (!someObj.hasOwnProperty(x)) continue;
  // now x was definitely defined on someObj
}
for (const x of Object.keys(someObj)) { // note: for _of_!
  // now x was definitely defined on someObj
}
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(someObj)) { // note: for _of_!
  // now key was definitely defined on someObj
}
```

##### Using spread syntax
Using spread syntax `{...bar}` is a convenient shorthand for creating a shallow copy of an object. When using spread syntax in object initialization, later values replace earlier values at the same key.

```typescript
const foo = { num: 1 };
const foo2 = { ...foo, num: 5 };
const foo3 = { num: 5, ...foo };

foo2.num === 5;
foo3.num === 1;
```

When using spread syntax, the value being spread must match what is being created. That is, when creating an object, only objects may be spread; arrays and primitives (including `null` and `undefined`) must not be spread.

##### Computed property names
Computed property names (e.g. `{['key' + foo()]: 42}`) are allowed, and are considered dict-style (quoted) keys (i.e., must not be mixed with non-quoted keys) unless the computed property is a symbol (e.g. `[Symbol.iterator]`).

##### Object destructuring
Object destructuring patterns may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment to perform destructuring and unpack multiple values from a single object.

Destructured objects may also be used as function parameters, but should be kept as simple as possible: a single level of unquoted shorthand properties. Deeper levels of nesting and computed properties may not be used in parameter destructuring.

```typescript
interface Options {
  /** The number of times to do something. */
  num?: number;
  /** A string to do stuff to. */
  str?: string;
}

function destructured({num, str = 'default'}: Options = {}) {}
```

#### Classes

##### Class Declarations
Class declarations must not be terminated with semicolons:

```typescript
class Foo {
}
```

In contrast, statements that contain class expressions must be terminated with a semicolon:

```typescript
export const Baz = class extends Bar {
  method(): number {
    return this.x;
  }
}; // Semicolon here as this is a statement, not a declaration
```

##### Class Method Declarations
Class method declarations must not use a semicolon to separate individual method declarations:

```typescript
class Foo {
  doThing() {
    console.log("A");
  }
}
```

Method declarations should be separated from surrounding code by a single blank line.

###### Overriding toString
The `toString` method may be overridden, but must always succeed and never have visible side effects.

##### Static Methods

###### Avoid private static methods
Where it does not interfere with readability, prefer module-local functions over private static methods.

###### Do not rely on dynamic dispatch
Code should not rely on dynamic dispatch of static methods. Static methods should only be called on the base class itself (which defines it directly).

###### Avoid static this references
Code must not use `this` in a static context.

```typescript
class ShoeStore {
  static storage: Storage = ...;

  static isAvailable(s: Shoe) {
    // Bad: do not use `this` in a static method.
    return this.storage.has(s.id);
  }
}
```

##### Constructors
Constructor calls must use parentheses, even when no arguments are passed:

```typescript
const x = new Foo();
```

It is unnecessary to provide an empty constructor or one that simply delegates into its parent class because ES2015 provides a default class constructor if one is not specified.

##### Class Members

###### No #private fields
Do not use private fields (also known as private identifiers):

```typescript
class Clazz {
  #ident = 1;
}
```

Instead, use TypeScript's visibility annotations:

```typescript
class Clazz {
  private ident = 1;
}
```

**Why?** Private identifiers cause substantial emit size and performance regressions when down-leveled by TypeScript, and are unsupported before ES2015.

###### Use readonly
Mark properties that are never reassigned outside of the constructor with the `readonly` modifier.

###### Parameter properties
Rather than plumbing an obvious initializer through to a class member, use a TypeScript parameter property.

```typescript
class Foo {
  constructor(private readonly barService: BarService) {}
}
```

###### Field initializers
If a class member is not a parameter, initialize it where it's declared, which sometimes lets you drop the constructor entirely.

```typescript
class Foo {
  private readonly userList: string[] = [];
}
```

###### Getters and setters
Getters and setters, also known as accessors, for class members may be used. The getter method must be a pure function (i.e., result is consistent and has no side effects: getters must not change observable state).

```typescript
class Foo {
  constructor(private readonly someService: SomeService) {}

  get someMember(): string {
    return this.someService.someVariable;
  }

  set someMember(newValue: string) {
    this.someService.someVariable = newValue;
  }
}
```

##### Visibility
Restricting visibility of properties, methods, and entire types helps with keeping code decoupled.

- Limit symbol visibility as much as possible.
- Consider converting private methods to non-exported functions within the same file but outside of any class.
- TypeScript symbols are public by default. Never use the `public` modifier except when declaring non-readonly public parameter properties (in constructors).

```typescript
class Foo {
  bar = new Bar();  // GOOD: public modifier not needed

  constructor(public baz: Baz) {}  // public modifier allowed
}
```

#### Functions

##### Terminology
There are many different types of functions, with subtle distinctions between them:

- "function declaration": a declaration using the `function` keyword
- "function expression": an expression using the `function` keyword
- "arrow function": an expression using the `=>` syntax
- "block body": right hand side of an arrow function with braces
- "concise body": right hand side of an arrow function without braces

##### Prefer function declarations for named functions
Prefer function declarations over arrow functions or function expressions when defining named functions.

```typescript
function foo() {
  return 42;
}
```

Arrow functions may be used, for example, when an explicit type annotation is required.

##### Nested functions
Functions nested within other methods or functions may use function declarations or arrow functions, as appropriate. In method bodies in particular, arrow functions are preferred because they have access to the outer `this`.

##### Do not use function expressions
Do not use function expressions. Use arrow functions instead.

```typescript
bar(() => { this.doSomething(); })
```

Exception: Function expressions may be used only if code has to dynamically rebind `this` (but this is discouraged), or for generator functions (which do not have an arrow syntax).

##### Arrow function bodies
Use arrow functions with concise bodies (i.e. expressions) or block bodies as appropriate.

```typescript
// Block bodies are fine:
const receipts = books.map((b: Book) => {
  const receipt = payMoney(b.price);
  recordTransaction(receipt);
  return receipt;
});

// Concise bodies are fine, too, if the return value is used:
const longThings = myValues.filter(v => v.length > 1000).map(v => String(v));
```

Only use a concise body if the return value of the function is actually used.

##### Rebinding this
Function expressions and function declarations must not use `this` unless they specifically exist to rebind the `this` pointer. Rebinding `this` can in most cases be avoided by using arrow functions or explicit parameters.

```typescript
// Good: explicitly reference the object from an arrow function.
document.body.onclick = () => { document.body.textContent = 'hello'; };
```

##### Prefer passing arrow functions as callbacks
Callbacks can be invoked with unexpected arguments that can pass a type check but still result in logical errors.

Avoid passing a named callback to a higher-order function, unless you are sure of the stability of both functions' call signatures.

```typescript
// GOOD: Arguments are explicitly passed to the callback
const numbers = ['11', '5', '3'].map((n) => parseInt(n));
// > [11, 5, 3]
```

### Naming

#### Identifiers
Identifiers must use only ASCII letters, digits, underscores (for constants and structured test method names), and (rarely) the '$' sign.

##### Naming Style
TypeScript expresses information in types, so names should not be decorated with information that is included in the type.

Some concrete examples of this rule:
- Do not use trailing or leading underscores for private properties or methods.
- Do not use the `opt_` prefix for optional parameters.
- Do not mark interfaces specially (`IMyInterface` or `MyFooInterface`) unless it's idiomatic in its environment.
- Suffixing `Observable`s with `$` is a common external convention and can help resolve confusion regarding observable values vs concrete values.

##### Descriptive Names
Names must be descriptive and clear to a new reader. Do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting letters within a word.

Exception: Variables that are in scope for 10 lines or fewer, including arguments that are not part of an exported API, may use short (e.g. single letter) variable names.

```typescript
// Good identifiers:
errorCount          // No abbreviation.
dnsConnectionIndex  // Most people know what "DNS" stands for.
referrerUrl         // Ditto for "URL".
customerId          // "Id" is both ubiquitous and unlikely to be misunderstood.
```

```typescript
// Disallowed identifiers:
n                   // Meaningless.
nErr                // Ambiguous abbreviation.
nCompConns          // Ambiguous abbreviation.
wgcConnections      // Only your group knows what this stands for.
pcReader            // Lots of things can be abbreviated "pc".
cstmrId             // Deletes internal letters.
kSecondsPerDay      // Do not use Hungarian notation.
customerID          // Incorrect camelcase of "ID".
```

##### Camel Case
Treat abbreviations like acronyms in names as whole words, i.e. use `loadHttpUrl`, not `loadHTTPURL`, unless required by a platform name (e.g. `XMLHttpRequest`).

##### Dollar Sign
Identifiers should not generally use `$`, except when required by naming conventions for third party frameworks. See above for more on using `$` with `Observable` values.

#### Rules by Identifier Type

Most identifier names should follow the casing in the table below, based on the identifier's type.

| Style | Type |
|-------|------|
| UpperCamelCase | class / interface / type / enum / decorator / type parameters / component functions in TSX / JSXElement type parameter |
| lowerCamelCase | variable / parameter / function / method / property / module alias |
| CONSTANT_CASE | global constant values, including enum values |

##### Type Parameters
Type parameters, like in `Array<T>`, may use a single upper case character (`T`) or `UpperCamelCase`.

##### Test Names
Test method names in xUnit-style test frameworks may be structured with `_` separators, e.g. `testX_whenY_doesZ()`.

##### _ prefix/suffix
Identifiers must not use `_` as a prefix or suffix.

This also means that `_` must not be used as an identifier by itself (e.g. to indicate a parameter is unused).

##### Imports
Module namespace imports are `lowerCamelCase` while files are `snake_case`, which means that imports correctly will not match in casing style, such as

```typescript
import * as fooBar from './foo_bar';
```

##### Constants
Immutable: `CONSTANT_CASE` indicates that a value is intended to not be changed, and may be used for values that can technically be modified (i.e. values that are not deeply frozen) to indicate to users that they must not be modified.

```typescript
const UNIT_SUFFIXES = {
  'milliseconds': 'ms',
  'seconds': 's',
};
// Even though per the rules of JavaScript UNIT_SUFFIXES is
// mutable, the uppercase shows users to not modify it.
```

A constant can also be a `static readonly` property of a class.

Global: Only symbols declared on the module level, static fields of module level classes, and values of module level enums, may use `CONST_CASE`.

### Type System

#### Type Inference
Code may rely on type inference as implemented by the TypeScript compiler for all type expressions (variables, fields, return types, etc).

```typescript
const x = 15;  // Type inferred.
```

Leave out type annotations for trivially inferred types: variables or parameters initialized to a `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `RegExp` literal or `new` expression.

Explicitly specifying types may be required to prevent generic type parameters from being inferred as `unknown`. For example, initializing generic types with no values (e.g. empty arrays, objects, `Map`s, or `Set`s).

```typescript
const x = new Set<string>();
```

##### Return Types
Whether to include return type annotations for functions and methods is up to the code author. Reviewers may ask for annotations to clarify complex return types that are hard to understand.

There are two benefits to explicitly typing out the implicit return values of functions and methods:
- More precise documentation to benefit readers of the code.
- Surface potential type errors faster in the future if there are code changes that change the return type of the function.

#### Undefined and null
TypeScript supports `undefined` and `null` types. Nullable types can be constructed as a union type (`string|null`); similarly with `undefined`. There is no special syntax for unions of `undefined` and `null`.

TypeScript code can use either `undefined` or `null` to denote absence of a value, there is no general guidance to prefer one over the other. Many JavaScript APIs use `undefined` (e.g. `Map.get`), while many DOM and Google APIs use `null` (e.g. `Element.getAttribute`), so the appropriate absent value depends on the context.

##### Nullable/undefined type aliases
Type aliases must not include `|null` or `|undefined` in a union type. Nullable aliases typically indicate that null values are being passed around through too many layers of an application, and this clouds the source of the original issue that resulted in `null`.

Instead, code must only add `|null` or `|undefined` when the alias is actually used. Code should deal with null values close to where they arise.

```typescript
// Better
type CoffeeResponse = Latte|Americano;

class CoffeeService {
  getLatte(): CoffeeResponse|undefined { ... };
}
```

##### Prefer optional over |undefined
In addition, TypeScript supports a special construct for optional parameters and fields, using `?`:

```typescript
interface CoffeeOrder {
  sugarCubes: number;
  milk?: Whole|LowFat|HalfHalf;
}

function pourCoffee(volume?: Milliliter) { ... }
```

Optional parameters implicitly include `|undefined` in their type. However, they are different in that they can be left out when constructing a value or calling a method.

Use optional fields (on interfaces or classes) and parameters rather than a `|undefined` type.

#### Use Structural Types
TypeScript's type system is structural, not nominal. That is, a value matches a type if it has at least all the properties the type requires and the properties' types match, recursively.

When providing a structural-based implementation, explicitly include the type at the declaration of the symbol (this allows more precise type checking and error reporting).

```typescript
const foo: Foo = {
  a: 123,
  b: 'abc',
}
```

Use interfaces to define structural types, not classes.

#### Prefer interfaces over type literal aliases
TypeScript supports type aliases for naming a type expression. This can be used to name primitives, unions, tuples, and any other types.

However, when declaring types for objects, use interfaces instead of a type alias for the object literal expression.

```typescript
interface User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}
```

**Why?** These forms are nearly equivalent, so under the principle of just choosing one out of two forms to prevent variation, we should choose one. Additionally, there are interesting technical reasons to prefer interface.

#### Array<T> Type
For simple types (containing just alphanumeric characters and dot), use the syntax sugar for arrays, `T[]` or `readonly T[]`, rather than the longer form `Array<T>` or `ReadonlyArray<T>`.

For anything more complex, use the longer form `Array<T>`.

```typescript
let a: string[];
let b: readonly string[];
let c: ns.MyObj[];
let d: string[][];
let e: Array<{n: number, s: string}>;
let f: Array<string|number>;
let g: ReadonlyArray<string|number>;
```

#### any Type
TypeScript's `any` type is a super and subtype of all other types, and allows dereferencing all properties. As such, `any` is dangerous - it can mask severe programming errors, and its use undermines the value of having static types in the first place.

Consider not to use `any`. In circumstances where you want to use `any`, consider one of:
- Provide a more specific type
- Use unknown
- Suppress the lint warning and document why

##### Using unknown over any
The `any` type allows assignment into any other type and dereferencing any property off it. Often this behaviour is not necessary or desirable, and code just needs to express that a type is unknown. Use the built-in type `unknown` in that situation — it expresses the concept and is much safer as it does not allow dereferencing arbitrary properties.

```typescript
// Can assign any value (including null or undefined) into this but cannot
// use it without narrowing the type or casting.
const val: unknown = value;
```

#### Control Structures

##### Equality checks
Always use triple equals (`===`) and not equals (`!==`). The double equality operators cause error prone type coercions that are hard to understand and slower to implement for JavaScript Virtual Machines.

```typescript
if (foo === 'bar' || baz !== bam) {
  // All good here.
}
```

Exception: Comparisons to the literal `null` value may use the `==` and `!=` operators to cover both `null` and `undefined` values.

##### Type assertions
Type assertions (`x as SomeType`) and non-nullability assertions (`y!`) are unsafe. Both only silence the TypeScript compiler, but do not insert any runtime checks to match these assertions, so they can cause your program to crash at runtime.

Instead of the following:

```typescript
(x as Foo).foo();
y!.bar();
```

When you want to assert a type or non-nullability the best answer is to explicitly write a runtime check that performs that check.

```typescript
// assuming Foo is a class.
if (x instanceof Foo) {
  x.foo();
}

if (y) {
  y.bar();
}
```

###### Type assertion syntax
Type assertions must use the `as` syntax (as opposed to the angle brackets syntax). This enforces parentheses around the assertion when accessing a member.

```typescript
// z must be Foo because ...
const x = (z as Foo).length;
```

### Comments and Documentation

#### JSDoc versus comments
There are two types of comments, JSDoc (`/** ... */`) and non-JSDoc ordinary comments (`// ...` or `/* ... */`).

- Use `/** JSDoc */` comments for documentation, i.e. comments a user of the code should read.
- Use `// line comments` for implementation comments, i.e. comments that only concern the implementation of the code itself.

JSDoc comments are understood by tools (such as editors and documentation generators), while ordinary comments are only for other humans.

#### Multi-line comments
Multi-line comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code. They must use multiple single-line comments (`//`-style), not block comment style (`/* */`).

```typescript
// This is
// fine
```

Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.

#### JSDoc general form
The basic formatting of JSDoc comments is as seen in this example:

```typescript
/**
 * Multiple lines of JSDoc text are written here,
 * wrapped normally.
 * @param arg A number to do something to.
 */
function doSomething(arg: number) { … }
```

or in this single-line example:

```typescript
/** This short jsdoc describes the function. */
function doSomething(arg: number) { … }
```

If a single-line comment overflows into multiple lines, it must use the multi-line style with `/**` and `*/` on their own lines.

#### Markdown
JSDoc is written in Markdown, though it may include HTML when necessary.

#### Document all top-level exports of modules
Use `/** JSDoc */` comments to communicate information to the users of your code. Avoid merely restating the property or parameter name. You should also document all properties and methods (exported/public or not) whose purpose is not immediately obvious from their name, as judged by your reviewer.

Exception: Symbols that are only exported to be consumed by tooling, such as @NgModule classes, do not require comments.

#### Method and function comments
Method, parameter, and return descriptions may be omitted if they are obvious from the rest of the method's JSDoc or from the method name and type signature.

Method descriptions begin with a verb phrase that describes what the method does. This phrase is not an imperative sentence, but instead is written in the third person, as if there is an implied "This method ..." before it.

#### JSDoc type annotations
JSDoc type annotations are redundant in TypeScript source code. Do not declare types in `@param` or `@return` blocks, do not write `@implements`, `@enum`, `@private`, `@override` etc. on code that uses the `implements`, `enum`, `private`, `override` etc. keywords.

### Disallowed Features

#### Wrapper objects for primitive types
TypeScript code must not instantiate the wrapper classes for the primitive types `String`, `Boolean`, and `Number`. Wrapper classes have surprising behavior, such as `new Boolean(false)` evaluating to `true`.

```typescript
const s = new String('hello');  // BAD
const b = new Boolean(false);   // BAD
const n = new Number(5);        // BAD
```

The wrappers may be called as functions for coercing (which is preferred over using `+` or concatenating the empty string) or creating symbols.

#### Automatic Semicolon Insertion
Do not rely on Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI). Explicitly end all statements using a semicolon. This prevents bugs due to incorrect semicolon insertions and ensures compatibility with tools with limited ASI support.

#### Const enums
Code must not use `const enum`; use plain `enum` instead.

**Why?** TypeScript enums already cannot be mutated; `const enum` is a separate language feature related to optimization that makes the enum invisible to JavaScript users of the module.

#### Debugger statements
Debugger statements must not be included in production code.

```typescript
function debugMe() {
  debugger;  // BAD
}
```

#### Dynamic code evaluation
Do not use `eval` or the `Function(...string)` constructor (except for code loaders). These features are potentially dangerous and simply do not work in environments using strict Content Security Policies.

#### Non-standard features
Do not use non-standard ECMAScript or Web Platform features.

This includes:
- Old features that have been marked deprecated or removed entirely from ECMAScript / the Web Platform
- New ECMAScript features that are not yet standardized
- Proposed but not-yet-complete web standards
- Non-standard language "extensions" (such as those provided by some external transpilers)

#### Modifying builtin objects
Never modify builtin types, either by adding methods to their constructors or to their prototypes. Avoid depending on libraries that do this.

Do not add symbols to the global object unless absolutely necessary (e.g. required by a third-party API).

This comprehensive TypeScript Style Guide provides detailed guidance for writing consistent, maintainable TypeScript code following Google's established best practices.
- Use extends for generic constraints
- Use built-in utility types

## Code Formatting

- Maximum 80 characters per line
- Use 2 spaces for indentation, no tabs
- Always use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings, template literals for interpolation
- Use trailing commas in multiline structures

## Best Practices

- Use strict null checks
- Use array methods instead of loops
- Use object spread for copying
- Use destructuring for extraction
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use pure functions when possible
- Use function overloads for different signatures

## Testing

- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios

## Required File Header

All TypeScript files must begin with a standard header as described in the
[general coding instructions](general-coding.instructions.md). Example for
TypeScript:

```typescript
// file: path/to/file.ts
// version: 1.0.0
// guid: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
```
